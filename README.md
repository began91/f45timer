# F45 Timer

The [F45 Timer App](https://f45timer.com) creates a custom timer based on workouts from the popular fitness programs available at F45 gyms. The timer will guide you through various intervals of workouts and rest through a variety of workout stations. Your timed workouts can use the recommended curated workout stations that F45 has created, or you can easily create your own workout with stations based on your personal preferences and available equipment. Happy workouts!

# Getting Started

Use your favorite web browser on your computer, tablet, or mobile device to navigate to [f45timer.com](https://f45timer.com).

Select the date of the workout you'd like to complete, or navigate to the custom workout tab, where you can select your desired format and enter in your own workout stations.

Once you've picked the workout, simply click "Start Workout" and your timer will start. 

You can select whether to include a timed warmup period or start the workout right away if you've already got the blood pumping!

# Using the Timer

When the timer is displayed, you will be able to easily see your total elapsed time and time remaining for the workout at the top corners of the screen.

The current set time is displayed in large circle in the middle of the screen. Green background means workout, and red background means rest.

The workout station is shown underneath the countdown timer.

Buttons are available to go to the next or last set, pause/resume, or fast forward/rewind 5 seconds.

When your workout is over or you hit the "End Workout" button, you'll be shown a summary of your workout and have the option to reset for your next go!

# About
 
The F45 Timer App was created out of a necessity to be able to conduct F45 style workouts from the comfort of your own home/gym. While nothing can replace the great workout environment at an F45 gym, this removes one of the variables - the complex timing systems that would be otherwise impossible to manage while also conducting the workout.
